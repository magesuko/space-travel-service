AREAS NEED IMPROVEMENT: 
I was not sure if validation of the input fields were a part of this task but I tried to do in anyways for a better experience by using javascript. I know that the better way to do this would be using gov.uk's error template messages but to be able to do it properly I would have to spent more time on the task and I did not want to sumbit this assigment too late. Thank you for your understanding.
