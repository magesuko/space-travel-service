# Space Travel Service

Space Travel Service takes you to Space :rocket:, for free!

This is a simple service prototype to demonstrate my UI & UX skills by using **govuk-design-system** library components. I've tried to comply with the gov.uk standards mentioned [here](https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/tutorials-and-guides).

It showcases
* Nunjucks usage
* Branching
* Data passing
* Route definitions
* And of course, my understanding of how an intuitive UX design should be.

## Give It a Try
Just click on [this link]([http://aljdlfjadf](https://space-travel-services-4292c2de163c.herokuapp.com)) to see the Heroku instance running this repository. (It's protected with a password which will be provided to the relevant people.)

## Heroku
The Heroku instance has a pipeline that actively watches this repository and builds/deploys automatically when a change is detected.

## Possible Improvements
* Currently, input field validations are JavaScript-based to keep it simple. It could be replaced with the library component `govukErrorSummary` to be aligned with the standards, but with more effort.
